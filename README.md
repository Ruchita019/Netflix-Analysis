# Netflix-Analysis
Netflix is a popular online streaming service that offers a vast library of movies, TV shows, and original content, accessible through subscription plans on various devices. To analyze this vast streaming platform I used the ***Power BI*** tool to create an insightful dashboard.

## Overview
The dashboard provides information such as:
 1. Which country produces the maximum content on Netflix
 2. Ratio of the number of Movies and TV Shows
 3. Type the genre of the Movies or TV Shows
 4. Rating of the Movies or TV show
 5. Shows the Cast, Description, Type, and Duration of the selected Movie or TV Shows
